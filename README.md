## Design Considerations

When developing the admin portal, several critical factors were considered:

### User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

-   **Consistency with Branding**: The portal's design aligns with the organization's branding, ensuring a professional and user-friendly interface.
-   **Responsive Design**: The web portal supports various screen sizes, providing seamless access across devices.
-   **Intuitive Dashboard**: The main dashboard offers a quick overview of pending tasks, employee statistics, and system alerts.

### Data Handling

-   **Firebase Integration**: The portal connects to Firebase Firestore to manage employee data, document uploads, and request statuses.
-   **Secure APIs**: It utilizes APIs hosted on Render for handling onboarding, login, and notifications. These APIs ensure secure communication using HTTPS and token-based authentication.
-   **Data Validation**: Frontend and backend validation is implemented to ensure accurate and clean data entries.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

-   **Unit Testing**: Key features such as data retrieval from Firebase, form submissions, and request handling are tested to ensure robustness.
-   **UI Testing**: Conducted to verify consistent user experience across different browsers and resolutions.
-   **Load Testing**: The application is tested to handle high traffic scenarios, ensuring reliability during peak usage.
